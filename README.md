The gmc_bboard_1.0_sla was code I built to get more up to speed with embedded development and working with the Beagle Bone Black microcontroller, motors, encoders, pwm, and various sensors using VegetableAvengers/BBBIOlib. I have utilized variations of the code in a few hobby based projects and it aided with working with more complex BeagleBone, Arduino and Raspberri Pi projects. The focus was getting the code to function with the custom hardware setup that I created and hooking up multiple motors to BBB. It also helped quite a bit when it was time to work on the GSAA software project.
